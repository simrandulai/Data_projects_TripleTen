### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 seperate excel files from the company Zomato. I used 2 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed exel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th 2017 and June 26th 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.

### Description:
- This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.
- 19 page Tableau Visualization
- Includes KPI cards, Pie charts, bar charts, RFM analysis, and dashboards.
- Purpose was to successfully complete the Zomato onboarding project to showcase analytical skills to the company.

### Assumptions:
- The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

### Process:
I first learned of the problem presented in it's entirety and it's requirements for approval.
Then, I chose the software and created my first submission, the "Decomposition Plan".
After, I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards for a second submission.
Lastly, I presented my findings in a report as my 3rd and final submission piece.

### Findings:
1. Customers mostly consist of 23-year-old unmarried men.
2. There is a natural distribution for age however the range is small at 18-34.
3. Women are close behind, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.
4. Zomatoâ€™s customers usually have small family sizes (2-3), educated, but unemployed.
5. Employed customers tend to be below middle class (50,000 INR/yr).
6. The Loyal Customer Segmentation has the most number of customers with At-risk as a close second.
7. Customers in the At-risk segmentation bring in the most revenue.

### Actionable Recommendations:
Based on the insights from the dashboard analysis, suggested actions can be summarized as retain, engage, monetize, re-engage, reconnect, or welcome. Specific recommendations are based on RFM segments.
