### Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'Superstore.xls'`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
    - `'orders'`: details all fields for each ordered item
    - `'returns'`: details all fields for each returned item

### Description:
- 8 page Tableau Visulization
- Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboard.
- Purpose was to consultant company by reviewing the storeâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

### Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.	
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- Operations department will need to make changes.
- Advertising department needs recommendations.

### Process:
I first joined sheets.
Then I determined profit and loss centers.
Lastly I examined the contribution returns had on profits.

### Findings:
1. Specific sub-categories were thriving or failing in different regions.
2. Some products have a negative profit and should be discontinued.
3. There are some sub-categories that are negative profit and should be discontinued.
4. There are some sub-categories that are high-profit and should get more focus.
5. The best advertising regions have different optimal time periods and budgets.
6. There are several products that have a return rate of 100% and hsould be discontinued.
7. The High-returns need to be investigated to prevent future problems.
