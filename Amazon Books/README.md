This was my Code Pudding Competition project that I worked on during the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a group project designed to showcase my Tableau, Storytelling, and Collaboration skills. I'm proud to say that our team ended up placing 1st! ðŸ¥‡

### Data
The data was one .csv file provided by TripleTen
- `'Books.csv'`: Original data. 1 Table with 11 Fields.
    - `'id'`: Unique Identifier
    - `'title'`: Book Title
    - `'author'`: Book Author
    - `'main genre'`: 
    - `'sub genre'`:
    - `'type'`: Paperback, Kindle Edition, or Hardcover
    - `'price'`: 
    - `'rating'`: 1-5
    - `'no of people rated'`:
    - `'urls'`:
    - `'indian currency price'`: in INR

### Description:
- 19 page Tableau Visualization with 3 Dashboards
- Includes parameters, calculations, and sets.
- Purpose was to create a visually compelling story from a provided dataset in 4 days with Tableau and collaboration.

### Assumptions:
- Missing values or inconsistencies in the data are minimal and can be ignored.
- The provided data was clean when provided to us.

### Process:
First, We held a Google Meet to organize our team details and technical details on how to best seemlessly share the work between time zones and workstations.
Then, we explored, filtered, and cleaned the data through Excel. We transformed the data from string format to numeric format. We also converted the prices from INR to USD. 
Next, we took turns passing the Tableau Workbook between members via Discord Chat based on availability. Keeping in constant connection and collaboration about our live edits through the same chat.
Simultaneously, preparing the presentation requirements, outline, and details in the same collaborative method via Discord and .txt file.
Lastly, we uploaded our assigned portions to the presentation and presented it during the competition.

### Findings:
- Sub-genres are evenly distributed with about 50 titles. 
- The same handful of book genres are at the bottom as they donâ€™t have multiple sub-genres. 
- The average price for main book genres is $6.33.
- Harry Potter dominates the top 10 bestselling books, commanding an average price above $10.
- J.K. Rowling is the top seller with a 4.7 rating.
- High-rated authors, especially with a perfect 5, sell significantly less.

### Actionable Recommendations:
1. Diversify Offerings: Expand into underrepresented genres and sub-genres to capture new audience segments.
For genres lacking multiple sub-genres, there exists potential for expansion and diversification to cater to varying reader preferences.
Crime, Thriller, & Mystery brings in a significant revenue of close to $10M, but only has one sub-genre. 
2. Strengthen Branding: Focus on building strong author brands and genre specialization to boost market presence.
Harry Potter dominates the top 10 bestselling books, despite it being more than the average price and not having perfect 5-star reviews. 
The branding and marketing behind the Harry Potter franchise overshadows the price and reviews. 

### Results:
Collaborative Brainstorming: I effectively worked with a team to identify interesting stories within provided datasets.
Data-Driven Storytelling: I focused on insights supported by data, ensuring clear and ethical use of information.
Visual Storytelling: I created unique data visualizations that complemented the narrative and communicated key points effectively.
Presentation Skills: I participated in crafting a clear and concise presentation that showcased our project's findings within a limited timeframe.

This project highlights my strengths in:
Data Analysis & Exploration (understanding and manipulating data)
Data Visualization (creating clear and informative visuals)
Communication & Teamwork (conveying insights and collaborating effectively)
